Data Structures are used to store and organize the data so that it can be used effeciently.

Need for Big O Notation:

Same implementation can take different time when it is run on Super Computer and Normal Computer.
Hence for determing performance based on number of steps Big O Notation was introduced, where performance is measured by taking 
number of steps into account.

Big O Notation -
Determines performance of the data structures
Describes the complexity of the data structure
Tells us how well an algorithm scales as the input increases.
Worst case is used to determine the time complexity of the algorithm.

O(1) - Constant time - No matter how many elements u have in your data structures, Algorithm always perform same number of operations
O(logn)(base 2) - Logarithamic - Slows rises as the number of elements increases Ex: Binary Search
O(n) - Linear - Descreases the performance as the elements decreases. Ex: For Loop, While Loop
O(nlogn)(base 2) - n log-star-n Logarithamic - Slows rises as the number of elements increases Ex: Binary Search
O(n^2) - Quadratic - As the number of elements increase, performance becomes very very low. Ex: Loop within loop
O(c^n) - Exponential - Recusrive calls over n and loop over c in it.
O(n!) - Factorial - Looping over n and recursive call in the loop for (n-1) elements

Data Structures Performancen for average case: 
                Access    Search    Insert    Delete
Stack           O(n)      O(n)      O(1)      O(1)
Queue           O(n)      O(n)      O(1)      O(1)
Linked List     O(n)      O(n)      O(1)      O(1)
Hash Table      O(1)      O(1)      O(1)      O(1)
Binary Tree     O(logn)   O(logn)   O(logn)   O(logn)

Array:
Arrays are not dynamic data structure. 
Once created we cannot increase or decrease the size.
int intArray[] = new int[7]; - Integer Array which can hold max 7 elements starting from position 0.

Arrays in Memory:
  - Stored as one contigous block in memory.
  - Hence length has to specified while creating an Array.
  - Every element in an Array occupies same amount of space in memory.
  - In case of Object Array. Arrays will have only Object Reference. Hence same size.
  - If an array starts at memory address is x, and size of each element is y, then we get the position of ith element in the array.
    By using the formula x+i*y
  - Ex: Start Address of Array : 12, Element Size: 4
    Address of array[0] = 12+4*0 = 12
    Address of array[1] = 12+4*1 = 16
    Address of array[2] = 12+4*2 = 20
    Address of array[3] = 12+4*3 = 24
    Address of array[4] = 12+4*4 = 28
    
Performance of Array:

Operation                                                       Time Complexity
Retrieve with index                                             O(1) - Constant time                                                                      
Retrieve without index(We need to search for an element)        O(n) - Linear time
Adding an element to the full array                             O(n) - Linear time  
(Create a brand new Array that takes existing and new elements.)
Adding an element to the end of an array                        O(1) - Constant time
Insert/Update at specific location                              O(1) - Constant time
Deleting an element by setting it to null                       O(1) - Constant time
Deleting an element by shifting elements                        O(n) - Linar time

Methods of Stack: LIFO - Last In First Out

push() - Adds an item to the top of a stack
pop() - Removes an item from the top of a stack
contains() - Checks if an element exists in the stack
access() - Pops all the element till an item is found

Methods of Queue: FIFO - First In First Out

enQueue - Inserts an element into a queue
deQueue - Removes an element into a queue
search - Search for an element in a queue
access

List 
  - An Order Collection. 
  - Implements AbstractList and AbstractSequentialList
  - For creating data structure similar to array list AbstractList has to be extended
  - For creating sequential data structure similar to linked list AbstractSequentialList has to be extended
  - It is not a concrete data structure, it is abstract data type.
  
Abstract Data Type
  - Doesn't dictate how that data is organized
  - Dictates the operation you can perform
  - In Java, Concrete Data Structure is represented by Class
  - Abstract Data Structure is represented by Interface
  - Any class that implements List is a list

ArrayList 
  - Resizable Array Implementation of the List Interface
  - If we know the position of an element in the list accessing the element takes O(1).
  - Adding items to the list takes more time if array is full. Since we need to create new array and copy all values.
  - Removing an element as well takes more time, since it requires shifting of all the elements.
  - Capacity - Max number of items that list can hold before it is resized
  - Size - Number of items present in the list
  - Initial capacity - 10, If more than items are expect to add in the list, Capacity has to be specified.
  - Not synchronized, Not thread safe.
  
Methods of ArrayList:
  - add(element) - Adds an element at the end of the list
    + Checks first if the backing array is full, if it is full it will resize the array.
    + Then element is added to the array
  - set(index,data) - Updates the value at given index 
  - add(index,data) - Adds an element at particular index
    + Internally System.arraycopy() function is used to shift all the elements to one position right wards before adding element
    + After shifting all the elements, new element is set at the specified index.
  - contains(data)
    + By default contains method uses only objects reference to compare, If equals and hashCode() method is not overridden. (==)
    + If equals and hashCode() method is overridden, contains uses it for searching an element in the list.
    + returns false if not found
  - indexOf(data)
    + Behavior is similar to contains method.
    + returns -1 is not found
  - remove(data)
    + Shifts array towards the specified index by one position.
    + Sets last element to null and decrements the size.
    
Vector 
  - Thread safe Array List, Not Synchronized!
  - Since JDK 1.0, exists earlier to ArrayList.
  - Performance is low, because of overhead associated with synchronization.
  - If thread safe implementation is not needed it is recomended to use Array List
  - Similar to Array List uses a backing array

Methods of vector
  - synchronized add(element) - Similar to arraylist, only difference is synchronization
  
Singly Linked List 
  - It will have only one link within each nodes
  - For traversing we got to start from head
  - Best used when we want to remove/add at the front of the list
  - Advantage: Resizing is not required like array because of links.
  - Disadvantages : Takes extra space for storing pointer.

Insert an element at the front of the list
  - Create a new node
  - Assign next of newly created node to head node
  - Assign head to newly created node
  - Takes O(1) time
  
Delete an element at the fron of the list
  - Copy head node to temporary field
  - Assign head to next of head node
  - Return temporary field
  - Takes O(1) time
  
Doubly Linked List
  - Each node points to next and previous item in the list
  - For first item previous points to null and for last item next points to null
  - We have reference to front and tail of the list, Hence insertion at front and last takes O(1) time
  
Insert at head
  - Create new Node
  - If Head is not null 
    + Assign next of new node to head node
    + Assign previous of head node to new node 
  - Else if head is null (new node is the first in the list)
    + Assign tail to new node
  - Assign head to new node
  - Takes O(1) time

Insert at tail
  - Create a new node 
  - If tail is not null
    + Assign previous of new node to tail 
    + Assign next of tail to new node
  - Else is tail is null (new node is the first in the list)
    + Assign head to new node
  - Assign tail to new node
  - Takes O(1) time
  
Remove a Node from head
  - Assign head to removedNode 
  - If removedNode's next is null (It means there is only one node in the list)
    + Assign null to tail
    + Assign null to head
  - Else
    + Assign removedNode's next to head
    + Assign head's previous to null
  - Assign null to removedNode's next
  - return removed node
  - Takes O(1) time
  
 Remove a Node from tail
 -  Assign tail to removed node
 - If removed node's previous is null (It means there is only one node in the list
    + Assign null to head
    + Assign null to tail
 - Else
    + Assign removed node's previous to tail
    + Assign tail's next to null
  - Assign remove node's previous to null
  - return removed node
  - Takes O(1) time

Insert Node A between Node B and Node C
  - Assign A's next to B's next
  - Assign A's pevious to C's previous
  - Assign B's next to A
  - Assign C's previous to A
  - Takes O(1) time , But finding insertion position takes O(n) time
  
LinkedList Java Class
  - Doubly Linked List implementation
  - Implements List and Dequeue Interfaces
  - Since it implements List interafce it has all methods of List Interface
  - It has its own  implementation of Node class
  - Implementation is not synchronized
  - For getting synchronized list - Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList())

Methods
  - void addFirst(data) - Adds an element at the front of the list
  - void addLast(data) - Adds an element at the end of the list 
  - boolean add(data) - Adds an element at the end of the list - Returns true on success
  - removeFirst() - Removes an element from the front of the list
  - removeLast() - Removes an element from the last of the list
  - remove() - Removes an element from the front of the list
  
Stack
  - Abstract Data Type
  - Last In First Out - LIFO
  - Stack can be backed by any data structures
  - Last item we add to the stack is always first item to be removed
  - push() - adds an item as the top item of the stack
  - pop() - removes an item from top of the stack
  - peek() - gets the top item of the stack
  - Linked List can be used as a data structure for stack
  - Takes O(1) for push(), pop() and peek() operation if we use Linked List
  - Takes O(n) for push() operation if we use Array, coz we need to resize the array when it is full
  - Takes O(1) for peek() and pop() if we use Array.

Queue
  - Abstract Data Type
  - First In First Out - FIFO
  - First item added is the first item to be removed
  - add() - also called enqueue - adds an item to the end of a queue
  - remove() - also called dequeue - removes an item from the front of the queue
  - peek() - get the item from the front of the queue, but don't remove it
  - Queue can be backed with Array or Linked List.
  
Implementation: 
  - add()
    + Check if back equals to length of the queue to verify if queue is full
    + If queue is full, resize the queue
    + if (back == queue.length-1) { //resize the queue }
    + Else add an element at back position and increment back
  - remove()
    + Check if queue is empty, if empty throw a NoSuchElementException
    + Assign element at the front of the queue to a variable
    + Assign position at the front of the queue with null
    + Increment front
    + return the assigned variable
    + If size is 0 re-initialize front and back to 0
  - size()
    + return (back - front) as the size of the queue
  - peek()
    + Throw a NoSuchElementException, if queue is empty
    + return element at the front of the queue
    
Disadvantages of Queue
  - If more elements are removed and added in succession, size of array shoots up whereas elements would be either 1 or not.
  - Array would be filled with empty spaces
  
Circular queue
  - For overcoming the dis-advantages of regular Queue we would go for Cicular Queue
  - Here we wrap the back of the queue with the front of the queue
  - Back would be connected to the front of the queue

Implemenatation
  - add()
    + Alter the condition which was used to check if queue is full
    + Check if queue is full by making use of size() method instead of relying on back variable
    + if (size() == queue.length-1) { //resize the queue }
