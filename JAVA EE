Servlet - A very simple JAVA class which can take a request in and gives response back.

Web Application Request Flow
  - Browser sends HTTP Request to web server
  - Web server responds with HTTP Response to the browser
  - Code in Web Server => Input: HttpRequest , Output: HttpResonse
  
Actions in CDI (Context Dependency Injection)
  - When we package and Deploy Components CDI Run Time Environment(Bean Manager) is triggered
  - Bean Manager discovers the Beans
  - Spot the dependencies
  - Inject the dependencies
  - All the Beans would be connected
  
  Bean Mananger
    - Manages Beans
    - Bean Discovery
    - Detect errors in Bean Definitions and deployment problems
    - If errors are found. deployment is cancelled
    - If no errors, Provide service - Injection
    
  CDI Bean
    - Any Java class with default constructor
  
  Lifecycle:
    - Container creates new CDI Bean Instance
    - It exists in memory, But we cannot use it
    - If newly created Bean uses Dependency Injection, container injects all the dependencies
    - Method Annotated with @PostConstruct is invoked for initialising
    - Finally Bean instance processes Method Invocation
    - If container no longer needs that Bean, it invokes method annotated with @PreDestroy and ends life cycle
    
   Scopes:
   
   @ApplicationScoped: One Instance exists throughout the application
   @SessionScoped: Instance exists per HTTP Session
   @RequestScoped: Instance exists per HTTP Request
   @ConversationScope: Instance exits during conversation between client and server
