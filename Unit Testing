Mockito

   - @Mock  : Used for creating mock objects.
   - @InjectMocks : Creates an instance of the class and injects all the mocks into it.
   - When a class uses service level class to get the inputs for the function, Mockito can be used to mock the inputs.
   - Mock class acts as a service level class for that class.
   - Ex: 
        // Creating mock object of the DataService
        @Mock
        DataService dataServiceMock;

        // For Injecting the dependency to the class
        @InjectMocks
        SomeBusinessImpl someBusinessImpl;

        @Test
        public void testFindTheGreatestFromAllData() {
          when(dataServiceMock.retrieveAllData()).thenReturn(new int[] { 24, 6, 15 });
          assertEquals(24, someBusinessImpl.findTheGreatestFromAllData());
        }
