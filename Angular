Front End Application 
Traditional Approach
  - Write HTML
  - Write JavaScript
  - Embed JavaScript into HTML
  - When HTML loads JavaScript also loads
  - JavaScript can modify the DOMs

Component based Approach
  - Create a component
  - Create a selector for that component Ex: header-section
  - Use the selector to render the component Ex: <header-section></header-section>
  - Components can have sub-components
  - Root component of Angular application - app-root - <app-root></app-root>
  - Component is split into 3 files
    + HTML
    + CSS
    + TypeScript
  - Starting point of Angular App - Index.html - Root element will be added here
