Lambda Expression - A method that doesn't need a access modifier, name or return value declaration. It takes input and returns result.

3 parts of Lambda - 
Parameter List - Can have zero or more parameters
Arrow operator - Separates Parameter list and body
Body - Piece of code that we are supposed to execute. Braces are optional

Ex: Arrays.asList("A","B","C").forEach(element->System.out.println(element))

Return Type of Lambda Expression is a Functional interface.

Functional Interface - Interface with only one abstract method.

Uses of Stream API

Helps using data in a declarative way. We can use functions like max min without iterating completetly.
Pipelines of data operations can be executed in parallel or in sequence.
Support for group by, order by operations etc
Functional Programming
Paralle processing of data

Intermediate vs Terminal Operation
