Lambda Expression in JAVA 8
  - It is an annonymous function. Function without a name
  - It is a method that doesn't need access modifiers, name or return type declaration. 
  - It accepts set of input parameters and returns result.
  Ex: Below expression takes stream of input as input and prints each element to console
  Arrays.asList("A","B","C").forEach(element->System.out.println(element))
  
  - 3 parts of Lambda
    1. Parameter List - (element) -  Can have zero or more parameters. Specifying the type of argument is optional
    	+ () : Indicates function doesn't take any arguments. It is mandatory to specify when using no-arg annonymous function
	+ value : Indicates function accepts only one arguments. Brackets are optional in case of single argument
	+ (key,value) : Indicates that function accepts 2 arguments. 
    2. Lambda Arrow operator - (->) - Separates Parameter list and body
    3. Body - (System.out.println(element)) - Piece of code that we are supposed to execute. Braces are optional

  - Return Type of Lambda Expression is a Functional interface. Most of the time java.lang.Runnable Interface.
  
Method Reference: 
	- Should be used where you receive an argument and pass it on.
	- Can be used for function with 1 parameter or 2 parameters
	- Should not be used where we need to perform some operations with the arguments.
	- Cannot be used if there is a conflict between static method and instance method. Throws an error if there is an ambiguity

Stream 
	- An abstraction : Stream is not a physical object with data. It is a bunch of functions
	- Non-mutating pipeline : You have function composition as pipeline of transformation. As data flows through the transformation
	data gets tranformed from one state to other. But data is mutated.
	
Reasons of Java 8 Release
  - Functional Programming
    + Main theme of Java 8 is support for functional programming
  - Cloud computing
    + Lambda Expression is very usefull in Cloud computing
    + We can pass code as data and we can run the same code on multiple servers
  - Big Data
    + With increase in Database size and growth of multi-code CPU servers, there is need for Java to support these large scale systems
    + Support of streams helps in this case
  - Optional
    + Best practise borrowed from Google's Guava Library for handling exceptional cases
    + This has made programs more robust with support for edge cases

Advantages of Lambda Expression
  - Useful for passing code as a data in a method
  - We can pass method as a parameter
  
Functional Interface in Java 8
  - Interface with only one abstract method.
  - It can have default methods with implementation
  - A default method is not abstract
  Ex: Runnable, Callable
 
Single Method Abstract(SAM) in Java 8
  - Other name of fuctional interface
  - Interface with one functional interface

Defining a functional interface in Java 8
  - Create a interface and write one abstract method in it
  - Annotate the interface with @FunctionalInterface annotation

Why do we need Functional Interface?
  - Functional Interfaces are mainly used lambda expression, method references and constructor references
  - Code can be treated as data
  - Piece of code can be passed as argument
  - Serves as data type for lambda expression
  - Method implemented by functional interface is passed as a code to a method

Is it mandatory to mark Functional Interface with @FunctionalInterface annotation?
  - Not mandatory
  - But if we annotate a interface which has more than 1 abstract methods with @FunctionalInterface, compiler will throw an error.

Difference between Collection and Stream API
  - Version
    + Collection API is used since Java 1.0
    + Stream is recently introduced in Java 1.8
  - Usage
    + Collection API is used for storing data in different kinds of Data Structures. Ex: List ,Set
    + Stream API is used for computation of data on large of set of objects
  - Finite
    + Collection API is used for storing finite number of elements. Ex: List of students
    + Stream API can handle stream of data, that contains infinite number of elements. Ex: Log files
  - Eager vs Lazy
    + Collection API constructs objects in eager manner
    + Stream API constructs objects in lazy manner
  - Multiple consumption
    + Most of the collection supports iteration and consumption of elements multiple times
    + Stream API can consume/iterate elements only once
    
Uses of Stream API
  - Helps in using data in a declarative way
  - We can make use of database functions like max() min()
  - It makes use of multicore architecture without worrying about multi threading code
  - We can create pipeline of Data operations with Java Stream that can run in a sequence or parallel. Ex: Data warehousing
  - It supports group by, order by operations
  - We can write the code in Functional Programming style
  - Supports parallel processing of data

Difference Intermediate and Terminal Operations
  - Evaluation
    + IO is not evalualated until we chain it with a terminal operation
    + IO is done at intermediate state
    + TO can be evaluated independently
    + TO is the last opertion
  - Output
    + Output of IO is another stream of data
    + Output of TO opertion is not a stream
  - Lazy Evaluation
    + IO are evaluated in lazy manner
    + TO are evaluated in eager manner
  - Chaining
    + Multiple IO can be chained
    + TO can be changed multiple times
  - Multiple
    + IO can be mulitple in stream processing
    + TO can be used only once in stream processing
    
Spliterator in Java 8
  - It is iterator used to traverse and partition elements of a source
  - We can traverse elements sequentialy and individualy in bulk
  - Source can be IO Channel OR Collection or Generator Function

Difference between Iterator and Spliterator
  - Usage
    + Spliterator can be used with Streams
    + Iterators can be used only with Collection objects
  - Iteration
    + Spliterator uses Internal Iteration
    + Spliterator can iterate streams in parallel/sequential manner
    + Iterator uses External Iteration
    + Iterator can only iterate in sequential manner
  - Traverse
    + Spliterator can traverse elements in bulk/individualy
    + Iterator can only traverse elements  individualy
 
Type Inference in Java 8
  - Compiler can see each method's invocation and declaration and determines the type arguments required for invocation
  - By type inference Java Compiler can determine the type of arguments as well as the type of result being returned
  - Type Inference Algorithm looks for most specific type that can work with all types of arguments
  Ex: When getNumber is invoked with "d" string and TEN, in this case Java Compiler comes to know that return type is BigDecimal
  static<T> T getNumber(T a1, T a2) {return a2;}
  BigDecimal bigD = getNumber("d",BigDecimal.TEN);

Does Java 7 support Type Inference
  - Yes it supports but limited to only methods
  - In Java 8 Type Inference is enhanced. Now it can be used with lambda expressions, functions and method references
  - Dynamically compiler can know what is return type and what is the type of arguments
  
How does internal iterator works in Java 8
  - When collection controls the iteration it is called external iteration
  - Collection has its own state
  - When iterator controls the iteration it is called internal iteration
  - Easier to implement we need to store the state
  
Difference between internal and external iterators
  - Control
    + Collection controls the external iterator
    + Iterator controls the internal iterator
  - Iterate the elements
    + External iterator can iterate elements only individually
    + In External iterator, elements are iterated in sequentially
    + Internal iterator can iterate elements individually/bulk
    + Int Internal iterator elements are iterated in squential as well as parallel manner

Advantages of internal iteration over external iteration
  - Internal works based on functional programming
  - Code is more readable and concise
  - It supports concurrency and parallel processing

Uses of internal iteration
  - Application that requires high performance, parallel processing and bulk operations

Disadvantages of internal iteration
  - Developer will not have control over the iteration since Java API controls the iteration

Creating concrete methods in interface
  - default method : method marked with default keyword, Marks the default behavior of the class that implements the interface
  - static method

Why do we need default methods in an interface in Java 8 ? 
  - For provding backward compatibility
  - So that a class can implement a interface by providing only implementations that are supported by the class
  Ex: interface Car with 3 method start() stop() and fly(). Class BMW supports flying feature hence it can provide implementation for 
  all 3 methods, whereas Class Toyoto doesn't support flying feature. This problem is solved with default methods.
  
Why do we need static methods in an interface in Java 8 ? 
  - It is utility or helper method created at class level

Uses of static methods
  - Single class
    + No need of separate util class for storing utility methods. We can keep it in same interface
  - Encapsulation
    + Complete behavior of the class is encapsulated within same class. By eliminating util/helper classes
  - Extension
    + Easier to extend

Core ideas behind Date/Time API
  - Immutable-value classes
    + New API avoids thread safety and concurrency issues by ensuring that all core class are immutable and represent well defined values
  - Domain-driven design
    + New API is modelled on precise domain with classes that represent different use cases for Date and Time
  - Separation of chronologies
    + New API allows people to work with different callendar systems
    + It supports the needs of users in different areas of world
    Ex: Thailand doesn't follow ISO-8601
  
Advantage of new Date and Time API over old Date API
  - Concurrency
    + java.util.Date, SimpleDateFormatter classes were not thread safe
    + We had to deal with concurrency issues
    + With new API developer need not worry about concurrency issues
  - Better Design
    + API design was not good
    + Year was starting by 1900, Month starts by 0 and date starts by 1
    + In Java 8 Date Time API all these are handled very well
  - No need of 3rd Party Library
    + With the popularity of 3rd party library like Joda Time, Java has to make its native date/time API comparable
    + Now we can use JAVA API instead of 3rd Party library
    
Difference between Legacy Date/Time API and Java Date/Time API
  - Thread safety
    + Old API was not thread safe
    + New API is thread safe
  - Immutable 
    + Old API has many mutable objects
    + New API is based on immutable objects
  - Performance
    + Performance of old API is not good
    + New API performs better than old API
  - Readability
    + Old API is less readable and maintainable
    + New API is vert well designed and more readable
  - Month values
    + Old API range was 0-11
    + Old API range is 1-12
    
How can we get duration between 2 dates/times ?
  - Java 8 has a new class Duration which provides the utility for computing difference between 2 dates 
  - Duration.between(date1,date2) 

What is the new method family introduced in Java 8 for processing of Arrays in Multicore machines ?
  - Java 8 has enhanced Array class with methods that can run efficiently on multi core machines
  - Arrays.parallelSetAll(); 
  - Arrays.parallelSort();
  - Methods prefixed with parallel which sorts the large set of data parallel. It gives good performance because of parallel processing
  
How does Java 8 solve Diamond problem of Multiple inheritance ? 
  - If class extends more than one class with 2 different implementation for the same method it causes Diamond problem
  - In JAVA we hav remedy to solve this problem
  - method is prefixed by Interface name to invoking the parent class method
  Ex: Accessing super class method with Remedy, which solves diamond problem
  public interface BaseInterface { default void display() {} }
  public interface BaseOne extends BaseInterface {}
  public interface BaseTwo extends BaseInterface {}
  public class ChildClass implements BaseOne, BaseTwo {
    default void display(){
      BaseOne.super.display(); //BaseOne is Remedy used here
    }  
  }
  - It is mandatory for the child class to override the conflicting method
  - If we need super class of method to be invoked Remedy has to be used along with super keyword
  
Differences between Predicate, Supplier and Consumer
  - All three are Functional Interface and Annonymous Function, can be used as an assignment target for lambda expression
  - Predicate
    + Accepts one argument and returns one result Ex: isEqual() , and(), or()
  - Supplier
    + Accepts no argument and it returns a result Ex: get()
  - Consumer
    + Accepts one argument but doesn't return anything Ex: accept(), andThen()
  
Is it possible to have default method definition in an interface without marking it with default keyword?
  - No, we have to always mark default method with default keyword
  - Else compile time error would be thrown

Can we access static method using reference of an interface?
  - No, static method should be accessed using the name of the interface
  
How can we get name of Parameter using Reflection API?
  - Parameter.getName() to get the name of the parameter
  - We need to turn on this feature in Java Compiler
  - Compile source code by using command javac -parameter
  - Use Parameter class name to access methods like getName() , isNamePresent()
  - getName() returns parameter names
  - isNamePresent() checks if .class contains original parameters
  -  To set -parameters compiler argument in ellipse follow the below steps. 
    1. Go to Window-> Preferences-> Java-> Compiler 
    2. Select Store information about method parameters (usable via reflection) and click ok. This is equivalent to javac -parameters command. 
 
What is Optional in Java 8
  - It is a container object that may have a null or not null value.
  - If it has value isPresent() returns true.
  - Usefull in handling data with null values
  - Inspired Google' Guava Library

Uses of Optional
  - To avoid NullPointerException
  - It performs null checks at compile time, So we do not get Runtime Exception for a null value
  - Optional removes codebase pollution by removing unnecessary null checks
  - Can be used to handle the default case for a null data

Which method in Optional provides fallback mechanism in case of null value ?
  - orElseGet() method can be used as fallback mechanism for null data values
  
How can we get current time using Java 8 Date Time API
  - millis() method of Clock class can be used to get current time in milli seconds
  - instant() method of Clock class can be used to get current time in readable time
  Ex: Clock clock = Clock.systemUTC();
  System.out.println(clock.millis()); // Prints 1553594227952 - current time in millis
  System.out.println(clock.instant()); // Prints 2019-03-26T09:57:07.952Z - current time in readable format
  
Can we define a static method in an interface?
  - Yes we can define
  - static methods cannot be accessed using object reference, it can only be accessed by using Interface name
  - Ex: BaseOne.displayThree();

How can we analyze the dependencies in Java classes and packages?
  - jdeps can be used for analyzing package level and class level dependencies
  - clas name or jar file name can be passed as argument
  - returns the dependent jars and class names
  Ex: 
  jdeps NumberSquareMapper.class
  NumberSquareMapper.class -> C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_181\jre\lib\rt.jar
   com.practice.functionalProgramming (NumberSquareMapper.class)
      -> java.lang
      -> java.util.function

New JVM arguments introduced in Java 8
  - PermGen space of ClassLoader is removed. It is replaced by MetaSpace
  - For setting initial memory of Metaspace -XX:MetaSpaceSize 
  - For setting max memory of Metaspace -XX:MaxMetaSpaceSize 
  
New Annotations introduced in Java 8
  - @FunctionalInterface
    + Used to mark an interface as functional interface
  - @Repeatable
    + Used for marking another annotation
    + It indicates marked annotation can be applied multiple times
    
StringJoiner in Java 8
  - New class in Java to create a String
  - It can be used to construct sequence of charaters separated by a delimiter. 
  - It can optionally add prefix and suffix
  Ex: 
    StringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(":", "[", "]");
		joiner.add("Sunday");
		joiner.add("Monday");
		joiner.add("Tuesday");
		System.out.println(joiner.toString()); //[Sunday:Monday:Tuesday]
    
 What is the type of Lambda Expression?
  - Type depends on the context it is being used
  - It does not have any type of its own
  - Generally it is an instance of Funtional Interface

What is the target type of Lambda Expression?
  - Functional Interface
  - Lambda expression should have same parameter type as the parameter type of the function in the interface same applies with return type
  
Difference between interface with default method and abstract class
  - Instance variables
    + Interface cannot have instance variables
    + Abstract class can have instance variables
  - Constructors
    + Interface cannot have constructors
    + Abstract class can have constructors
  - Concrete methods
    + Interface cannot have concrete methods other than default methods
    + Abstract class can have concrete methods
  - Lamda
    + Interface with one default method can be used in lamda
    + Abstract class cannot be used in lambda
