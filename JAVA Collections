Collection Interfaces
  - List
  - Set 
  - Queue
  - Map

List 
  - Cares about which position each object is in
  - Elements can be added in by specifying position - where should it be added in
  - If element is added without specifying position - it is added at the end
  - Allows duplicate elements
  
List.of - creates a immutable list - We cannot add more elements

List<String> list = List.of("Cat","Bat");
list.add("Dog") - Throws an exception, since list is immutable when created by List.of().

Vector
 - All methods are synchronized, Thread Safe
 - Basic Data Structure : Array
ArrayList
 - Not Synchronized, Not Thread Safe
 - Basic Data Structure : Array
 - Insertion and Deletion are slower compared to Linked List
 - Constant access time
Linked List
 - Basic Data Structure : Doubly Linked List
 - Iteration is slow, Access time is slow
 - Faster insertion and deletion
