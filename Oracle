VARCHAR vs VARCHAR2

Both VARCHAR & VARCHAR2 are Oracle data types that are used to store character strings of variable length.

VARCHAR can store characters up to 2000 bytes while 
VARCHAR2 can store up to 4000 bytes.

VARCHAR will hold the space for characters defined during declaration even if all of them are not used whereas 
VARCHAR2 will release the unused space.

TRUNCATE vs DELETE

TRUNCATE is a DDL operation while 
DELETE is a DML operation.

TRANSLATE command translates characters one by one in the provided string with the substitution character. 
REPLACE will replace a character or a set of characters with a complete substitution string.
Ex: TRANSLATE (‘Missisippi’,’is’,’15) => M155151pp1 REPLACE (‘Missisippi’,’is’,’15) =>  M15s15ippi

Character Matching for LIKE Operator:
_(Underscore) -> Matched any single character. 
Ex: Select * from EMPLOYEE where FIRST_NAME like 'J___' -> first name starts with 'J' and name contains 4 letters
% -> Any number of characters
Ex: Select * from EMPLOYEE where FIRST_NAME like 'J%' -> first name starts with 'J'
