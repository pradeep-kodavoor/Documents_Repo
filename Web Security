Basic Authentication and Spring Security

REST services can be hit through any browser and get the data from server, So we need to secure the REST services

spring-boot-starter-security -> Adds security to the REST services

By Deafault Form Based Authentication is added to the application

Default password will be printed in logs.
For setting username & password  update below fields in property file.
spring.security.user.name=pradeep
spring.security.user.password=dummy

2 types of Authentication
- Basic Authentication 
  - We send Basic Authorization Header which represents Username and Password
  - Username and passoword is encoded and sent
  - We send this header as part of every request
  - No expiration time. Hence not secure.
- Form Based Authentication 
  - Based on session on the browser 
  - Needs an additional session at server
  
  Code snip for sending Basic Authentication Header in Angular
  
  let basicAuthHeadStr = 'Basic ' + window.btoa(username +':'+ password) 
  Note: there is a space after Basic.
  
  window.btoa -> Encodes a string to Base64 format.
  - Creating header
  let headers = new HttpHeaders({ 
      Authorization:basicAuthHeadStr
      })
      
  Each and every REST call should have Basic Authentication added
  
  When Authorization Header is added to the request header, A pre-flight request would be triggered prior to the actual request with Method:OPTIONS to check if we have right permissions
  
  WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter - Class containing default Security Configuration for Spring
  We need to override the methods to change the configuration
  
  CSRF - Will force POST and PUT request to have CSRF token 
  By Default Spring Security would enable CSRF Token hence we need to disable it externally for using JWT Tokens.
  
  Overriding Configure Method
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		System.out.println("Overridng Spring Security Con figuration!!");
		http
			.csrf().disable() // Disable CSRF token
			.authorizeRequests()
				.antMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, "/**").permitAll() //Any OPTIONS request that comes to any URL permit everybody
				.anyRequest().authenticated() //Rest of the request authorise
				.and()
				// .formLogin().and()
				.httpBasic();
	}
  
  HttpIntercepter - For adding Header to all the request, Acts like a filter
  
  Intercept the request
  Add the Basic Auth Header
  Send the request to next HttpHandler
  
  Provide implementation for configure method: 
  intercept(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler){
    let basicAuthHeadStr = 'Basic ' + window.btoa(username +':'+ password)
    request = request.clone({
      setHeaders : { Authorization:basicAuthHeadStr }
    });
    return next.handle(request)
  }
  
Disadvantages of Basic Authentication
  - No expiration time
  - No user details

Custome Token System - Had some flaws. JWT evolved.
JWT - JSON Web Token - Open Industry Standard RFC7519 method for representing claims securely between 2 parties 
WebSite of JWT - https://jwt.io
JWT Token has
	- Header - Algorithm names and type Ex: HS512
	- Payload - Few pre-defined elements like role of the user, creation time of user etc
	- Signature - Base64 Header and Payload and in addition to that a secret string.

Getting JWT Token 
	- POST Request to http://localhost:8080/authenticate 
	- Request Body : { "username": "in28minutes", "password": "dummy" }
	- Response : {token : token_value}
	
Refreshing a JWT Token - Increasing the expiration time
	- GET Request to http://localhost:8080/refresh
	- With Authorization Header : {Authorization: "Bearer token_value"}

Authorizing the request
	- We need to create a filer by implementing OncePerRequestFilter Interface 
	- It checks if token is present in the request
	- If token is present it validates the token - Checks the expiration time and gets the username from the token
	- If token is valid, it would load the user details and it would set it security context holder
	- SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(usernamePasswordAuthenticationToken)
	- This is used while processing the resource by all the servlets

Get the user details
	- User details can be stored in DB, LDAP or In-Memory
	- Spring security provides an interface - UserDetailsService for providing user details

AuthenticationEntryPoint
	- Implement AuthenticationEntryPoint for handling un-authorized requests
	
WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
	- Implement WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter Interface and configure th security
	- Provide the newly created AuthenticationEntryPoint
	- Provide Once Per Request Filter as well

Not REST Service call
	- Should be made by adding Authorization Header in the request headers

Statefull Authentication
  - Browser sends a POST request, with username and password
  - User data would be stored at server side
  - Server responds with a cookie that includes session ID to identify the user
  - Cookie is set on the browser
  - On every request server validates the session ID to authenticate the request

Disadvantages
  - Hard to scale: The server needs to create a session for a user and persist it somewhere on the server. 
    If we have a distributed system, we have to make sure that session is shared between multiple nodes.

  - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS): When using AJAX calls to fetch a resource from another domain (cross-origin) 
    we could run into problems with forbidden requests because, by default, HTTP requests don’t include cookies on cross-origin requests.

  - Coupling with the web framework: When using server-based authentication we are tied to our framework’s authentication scheme. 
    It is really hard, or even impossible, to share session data between different web frameworks written in different programming languages.
 
Stateless Authentication using JWT
  - Browser makes a request to the authentication server with user login information
  - Authentication server generates JWT token and sends it to client
  - Client stores the token sends it as part of every request as part of Authorization header
  - Server validates the token and returns secure resource to client
  
Advantages
  - Stateless, easier to scale: The token contains all the information to identify the user, eliminating the need for the session state.
    If we use a load balancer, we can pass the user to any server, instead of being bound to the same server we logged in on.

  - Reusability: We can have many separate servers, running on multiple platforms and domains, reusing the same token for 
    authenticating the user. It is easy to build an application that shares permissions with another application.

  - Performance: There is no server side lookup to find and deserialize the session on each request. The only thing we have to do is 
    validate the token and parse its content.
