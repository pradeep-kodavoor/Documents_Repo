Java Source File:
    - A source file can have any number of classes.But it can have max 1 public class.
    - If there are there more than one public class, Compiler asks us to declare the class in separate file.
    - If there is no pubic class, Any name can be used as Source File name.
    - A source file can have any number of main methods. For running any class it is mandatory to have main 
    method with JVM supported format
    
Compiling and Running Java Source Code with package declaration:
    - Full Directory Path has to be sepecified while compiling
    - D:\Users\734456\workspace\Core-Java-Practise\src\main\java>javac -d . T.java
    - Command create folders with package name in the current working directory
    - Fully Qualified class name has to be specified while running a class.
    - D:\Users\734456\workspace\Core-Java-Practise\src\main\java>java com.practice.sample.T

Import Statements:
    - Explicit Import : import java.util.ArrayList;
    - Implicit Import : import java.util.*;
    - Explicit import is always recommended since it improves readbility.
    - Implicit import statement will only import all classes present in the current package. Classes in the sub package are 
     not imported.
    - Ex: java.util.regex.Pattern will be imported by using import java.util.regex.*
    - import java.util.* will not import Patternn class.

Classes and Interfaces present in java.lang imported automatically. Ex: Thread, Exception.
All classes present in current working directory is available by default. No need of importing it.

Package : 
    - Encapsulation mechanism to group of related classes and interfaces to a single unit.
    - In any JAVA Source file atmost one package declaration is allowed.
    - Package declaration should be first statement in the source file always.

Order for JAVA Source file
    - package declaration
    - import statment
    - ass/interface/enums

Advantages: 
    - Naming conflicts
    - Modularity
    - Maintainability
    - Security

Class Level Access Modifiers - Provides information about the behavior of the class to JVM

Modifier applicable for top level class
public - class can be accessed by anywhere.
default - class can be accessed only within the package.


abstract - applicable for classes and methods
If a class has atleast one abstract method, it has to be declared abstract.

final - 
strictfp - 

Modifier applicable for inner class in addition to above modifiers
private -
protected - 
static

 Access Modifiers
   Class  - default: Accessible only inside the package, public: Visible everywhere
   Methods - public: Accessible everywhere, protected: Can only be used either in same package or sub-class
             private: Only available inside the class, default: Only available inside the package
             
   Protected Access Modifier:
         Members can be accessed throughout the package.
         In different package, 
              members can be accessed directly or by creating object and reference of sub class.
              members cannot be accessed by creating object and reference of super class.   
   
 Non-Access Modifiers
   final
      - Class cannot be extended 
      - Method cannot be overriden 
      - Variable value cannot be changed once it is assigned
      - Varibae value can be assigned only once if it is not initialized
   static
      - Variable are present at Class level
      - Single instance is available and shared accross all the objects
      - Methods cannot access instance variables or methods . But Instance methods can access static variables and methods
      - Methods can only access Static Methods and variables.
  
  Declaring constants : public static final int PI = 3.14;
    
JVM Memory Model:

Heap Area : Memory is allocated for Objects and arrays. Created when JVM starts.
Method Area : Methods and fields are stored. 
JVM Stacks: Local variable and partial results are stored. Stack frame is created for each thread.
Native Method Stacks: Supports native methods

Heap Memory : 

Heap Memory - Will store the objects
Stack Memory - Will store the variables

Primitive variable - will have variable values
Reference variable - will have reference to the memory location

Comparison of reference variable compares its memory location not the values of instance variables.

String - Immutable
Once created, value cannot be changed in the memory location.

IntegerCache
    - Feature introduced in JDK 5 for improving performance.
    - Integer num1 = Integer.valueOf(20), Integer num2 = Integer.valueOf(20) 
    - num1 == num2 will be true, Since value is cached and same reference would be used.
    - Default values that are cached -127 to 127
    - However it can be changed by altering VM parameter: -XX:AutoBoxCacheMax=1000

Creating Immutable Class in JAVA
    - Class should be declared as final, so that no other class can extend it.
    - All variables of the class should be declared private, so that it cannot be accessed outside.
    - There should not be any setter methods for modifying the variable values.
    - Perform deep cloning of all reference variables(If class has reference variable do not assign it directly, 
    instead extract the values of the reference variable and create a new Object).
    
Object.hashCode() and System.identityHashCode()
    - When Object.hashCode() is called first preference is given to the hashCode() method overridden by the class.
    - If hashCode() is not overridden, System.identityHashCode() is called to generate default hashCode of an object.

Variable Arguments. Takes any number inputs to a method. Introduced in JDK 5
Syntax : sum (int... marks) 
Sample method call: sum(2,3) sum(2,3,5)

Variable argument should always be last arugment inside a method.
Ex: sum(int length,int... num ) - Correct
Ex: sum(int... num, int length) - Wrong

Arrays:
int[] intArray = new int[5];
intArray = {1,2,3};
int[] newArray = {5,6,7}

Object Oriented Programming

Composition : Has-a relationship. Ex: Person has a Adress, Book has a Review, 
Inheritance : Is-a relationship. Ex: Student is a Person, Ferrari is a Car. 
Sub-class inherits all the state and behavior of the parent class.

Method Overriding - Overriding the implementation provided in the super class with new implementation.

super - Keyword to access state and behavior of parent class
this - keyword to access state and behavior of current class

OOPS Concepts 

	1. Data Hiding : Hiding of data, Outside class cannot access member data directly.
		Ex: Check for mail in GMAIL , We will not be able to view mails unless we provide credentials.
		- Implementation of data hiding
			+ private field mail is declared as Private
			+ public method is made available which can accept credentials and return the mail details
		- Advantage of Data Hiding
			+ Security : Only after providing credentials mail can be accessed
	
	2. Abstraction : Hiding the internal implementation, and only highlighting the set the services that we offer
		Ex: ATM Machine. When we request for withdrawl, we will only get money. But we will not get any information on 
		the internal implementation of withdrawl method. Bank will not never share such information.
		Ex: 
		- Implementation of abstraction
			+ provide abstract methods using Interface
			+ provding services only through GUI screens
		- Advantage
			+ Security : No one will be aware of internal implmentation
			+ Easy to enhance : We can keep same GUI and change the back-end technology
			+ Maintainanility and Modularity of application would be improved
			
	3. Encapsulation : 


MultiThreading

2 ways of creating thread
 - Extend Thread class
 - Implement Runnable Interface and pass the object to Thread class constructor
 
 Important Methods of Thread class : 
    - start() and run() 
        + Invoking start() method on thread object, executes run() method as a new thread of execution.
        + start() method caused OS to initiate another thread from which run() method executes
        + start() can be called only once on a thread or else IllegalThreadStateException would be thrown
        + run() can be called directly, in that it would operate like an other method as part of the same thread by which it is called
    - final isAlive()
        + returns true is Thread is still running or if Thread is not terminated
    - final join()
        + waits until Thread on which it is called is terminated
        + thread1.join(100) - waits for 1 sec for thread1 to get terminated then continues with normal execution.
    - yield()
        + Moves the current thread from Running to Runnable state
        + However scheduler can bring it back to Running state
        + Alternate approach as per Joshua Thread.sleep(1)
    - static currentThread()
        + Returns a reference to the current thread
    - void interrupt()
        + set the interrupt flag
    - static boolean interrupted()
        + static method, returns true if interrupted flag is set
        + clears the flag
    - boolean isInterrupted()
        + instance method, just return true if interrupted flag is set
    - static sleep()
        + Causes thread to suspend execution for some time
        + sleep(10) sleeps for 10 milliseconds
        + sleep(1,10) sleeps for 1 milliseconds and 10 nanoseconds
 
join() and sleep() methods of Thread class throws InterruptedException - Checked Exception.
It has to be handled whenever these methods are used

wait() method of Object class also throws InterruptedException - Checked Exception.

Executor Service - For creating multiple threads in a simpler ways and manage the size of thread pool
execute() - For invoking a normal task

Callable Thread - task which returns some value
submit(Callable task) -> Executes single callable task
invokeAll(Collection of Callable tasks) -> Executes multiple callable task at a time

Synchronization:
    - synchronized - Modifier applicable only for methods and blocks, but not for classes and variables.
    - If multiple threads are trying to operate simultaneously on the same Java object then there might be 
    chances of Data Inconsistency problem.
    - To overcome Data Inconsistency problem we are supposed to use synchronized keyword
    - If a method/block declared as synchronized then at a time only one thread is allowed to execute that method/block 
    on the given object so that data inconsistency problem will be resolved
Disadvantages:
    - Increases wait time of thread hence degrades performance

    - Internally synchronization is implement using lock
    - Object is locked when a thread executes a synchronized method
    - Acquiring and releasing lock operations are internally taken care by JVM, Programmer is not responsible.
    - While thread executes sychronized method on a object, remaining threads are not allowed to execute
    any sychronized method simultaneously on the same object, but the remaining threads are allowed to execute 
    non-synchronized methods simultaneously
    - Lock concept is implemented based on object not based on method
    - Every object in java has synchronized and non-synchronized area
    - Synchronized area - Can be accessed by only one thread at a time should be used for read operation
    - Non synchronized area - can be accesses by any number of threads at a time should be used to update operations
    
    - If 2 threads operate on same object synchronization is required
    - If 2 threads operate on 2 different objects synchronization is not required
    
 2 types of Locks in java
    - Class level lock
        + For executing static synchronized method thread requires class level lock
        + Thread releases the lock once it finishes executing
        + While static synchronized method is being executed by any thread, other threads are not allwoed to any of the other static 
        synchronized methods of that class simultaneously. But other threads are allowed to execute below methods:
            - Normal static methods 
            - Synchronized instance methods
            - Normal instance methods 
        
    - Object level lock
        + For executing synchronized instance method thread requires object level lock
     
Synchronous Block
    - Performance will be improved using blocks, since we need not synchronize complete method
    - Only certain lines can be synchronized
    - If only few lines code requires synchronization, then synchronized block is highly recommended.
    - It reduces waiting time of thread and improves performance of the system/application.
    - synchronized(this) - gets lock of current object, Only after getting lock thread can execute the block
    - synchronized(b) - gets lock of any particular object b
    - synchronized(Display.class) - get class level lock of Display class
    - synchronized() - is not applicable for primitives , Compilation error (Unexpected type found)
    - Lock concept applicable for object types and class types but not for primitives
    
What is synchronized keyword? where we can apply?
    - Modifier applicable for methods and blocks
Advantages of synchrnized keyword?
    - Helps to solve data inconsistency problem
Disadvantages
    - Increases wait time of thread, thus affecting performance
What is race condition?
    - Multiple thread operate simultaneously on same Java object and causing data consistency
How to resolve race condition?
    - Use synchronized keyword
    - If multiple threads are operating simultaneously on same Java object, then there may be chance of data inconsistency problem
    this is called race condition
    - We can overcome this problem by using synchronized modifier
What is object lock? When it is required?
    - Every object in java has a unique lock called object lock
    - For executing synchronized instance method object lock is required
What is class level lock? When it is required?
    - Every class in java has a unique lock called class level lock
    - For executing static synchronized instance method class level lock is required
While a thread is executing synchronized method on the given object, is the remaining threads allowed to execute any
other synchronized method simultaneously on the same object?
    - No, since object is locked
What is synchronized block?
How to declare the synchronized block to get the lock of current object?
    - synchronized(this)
How to declare the synchronized block to get the class level lock?
    - synchronized(Display.class)
Advantage of synchronized block over method?
    - Performance will be improved
    - Waiting time of thread is decreased
Can a thread acquire multiple locks simultaneously?
    - Yes, thread can acquire multiple locks from different objects.
What is synchronized statement?
    - Statements present inside synchronized methods and synchronized blocks

Inter Thread Communication - How 2 threads communicate with each other
    - 2 threads are communicate with each other by calling wait() , notify() and notifyAll() methods

Need for inter thread communication
    - When thread t1 is expecting an update from thread t2
    - T1 need to check every 5min for update
    - Instead t1 and t2 can communicate with each other by calling wait() and notify() method
    - t1 calls wait() method - thread which is expecting an update
    - t1 goes on waiting state after executing wait() method
    - t2 calls notify() method - thread which performs an update
    - Thread responsible for performing an update, after updating it should call notify() method then waiting thread will get he 
    notification and continues it execution with those updated items.
 
wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods are not part of Thread class, It is part of Object class why?
    - Thread can call these methods on any Java Object
    - Thread should have the ownership of object for calling wait() method
    - Thread should have the lock of the object 
    - Thread should be in synchronized area(either block or method)
    - If no access or not called from synchronized area, RuntimeException - IllegalMonitorStateException would be thrown
    - If a thread calls wait() method on any object, it immediately releases the lock of that object and enters to waiting state.
    - If a thread calls notify() method on any object, it releases the lock but may not be immediately.
    - Except wait(), notify() and notifyAll() there is no other method where thread releases the lock.

Which of the following is valid?
    - If a thread calls wait() method, immediately it will enter into waiting state without releasing lock. - Invalid
    - If a thread calls wait() method, it releases the lock of that object but may not immediately. - Invalid
    - If a thread calls wait() method on any object, it releases all locks acquired by the thread and immediately 
    enter into waiting state - Invalid
    - If a thread calls wait() method on any object, it immediately releases the lock of that particular object and 
    enter into waiting state - Valid
    - If a thread calls notify() method on any object, it immediately releases lock of that particular object. - Invalild
    - If a thread calls notify() method on any object, it releases the lock of that object but may not be immediately - Valid
    
Conclusion:
    - 2 threads can communicate with each other using wait(), notify() and notifyAll()
    - wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are present in object class
    - wait(), notify() and notifyAll() should be called from synchronized area only
    - If thread calls wait() method, thread immediately releases the lock
    - if thread call notify() method, lock is released but may not be immediately
    - Except wait(), notify() and notifyAll() there is no other method where thread releases the lock.

Syntax of wait() and notify() methods:
    - public final native void wait(long var1) throws InterruptedException(Checked Exception); - milli seconds
    - public final void wait(long var1, int var3) throws InterruptedException {} - milli seconds,nano seconds
    - public final void wait() throws InterruptedException { this.wait(0L); }
    - public final native void notify();
	- public final native void notifyAll();

    - Every wait() method throws InterruptedException which is Checked Exception, Hence wheneve we are using wait() method 
    exception should be handled by either by try catch or throws keyword, Otherwise we will get compilation error.
    
Importance of wait() notify() in Thread lif cycle
Normal Thread Life Cycle
    - MyThread myThread = new MyThread(); -> New
    - myThread.start(); -> Ready/Runnable
    - If thread scheduler allocates processor -> Running;
    - If run() method completes execution -> Dead 

Wait() method would be executed when thread is in Running state
    - When wait() method is executed thread goes to Waiting state
    - If Waiting thread gets notification it goes to another Waiting state to get the lock in below cases
        + If Waiting thread gets notification
        + If time expires
        + If Waiting thread gets interrupted
    - Once Waiting thread gets lock it goes to Ready/Runnable state
  
Producer Consumer Problem
    - Producer thread is responsible to produce items to the queue
    - Consumer thread is responsible to consume items from the queue
    - If queue is empty then consumer thread will call wait() method and enter into Waiting state
    - After producing items to the queue, producer thread is responsible to call notify() method then waiting consumer will get that no
    notification and continue its execution with updated items

Difference between notify() and notifyAll()
    - We can use notify() method to give notification for only one waiting thread
    - If multiple threads are waiting, then only one thread will be notified and remaining threads will have to wait for
    notifications.
    - We cannot expect any particular thread to be notified, it depends on JVM any random thread would be notified.
    - We can use notifyAll() for providing notification of all Waiting threads of a particular object.
    - Eventhough multiple threads gets notified, but execution will be performed one by one because threads require lock, and only one 
    lock would be available
    
- Only synchronized object has to be used inside synchronized block
    + Ex: Object o1 = new Object(); Object o2 = new Object();
    + synchronized(o1) { o2.wait(); } // Throws IllegalMonitorStateException
    
Java Multithreading is implemented using Green Thread Model and Native OS model
    - Green Thread: Thread is completely managed by JVM without taking underlying OS Support. Deprecated model. Ex: SUN Solaris OS 
    - Native OS Model: Thread managed by JVM with the help of underlying OS.Ex: All Windows based OS

How to stop a thread?
    - If we call stop() method immediately thread enters dead state.
    - stop() method is deprecated and not recommended to use

Deadlock - Infinte waiting, where 2 threads are waiting for each other forever
    - synchronized keyword is the only reason for deadlock
    - While using synchronized keyword, special care has to be taken
    - There is no resolution for deadlock, but several prevention techniques are available
    
Deadlock vs Starvation
    - Deadlock: Long waiting of a thread where waiting never ends
    - Starvation: Long waiting of a thread where waiting ends. Ex: Waiting for 100 threads with higher priority
    
Exception Handling

Finally block - 
 - Executes even if exception is raised
 - Even if return statement is present
 - Will not be executed if lines inside finally throws exception
 - If JVM crashes (System.exit(0)) - DO NOT TRY

2 types of Exceptions
- Sub-classes of Runtime Exceptions
- Not a Sub-class of Runtime Exceptions (All classes that extends Exceptions and not Runtime Exceptions)

class Error extends Throwable

class Exception extends Throwable
class InterruptedException extends Exception 
 - Checked Exception 
 - Any class that extends Exception 
 - Should be handled always by throwing or surrounding by try/catch 

class RuntimeException extends Exception
class NullPointerException extends RuntimeException 
 - Un-Checked Exception 
 - Any class that extends Runtime Exception
 - Not mandatory of handling the exception
 
 Functional Programming
 
 Stream - source of objects 
 
 2 Operations on stream
  - Intermediate operation - 
    Input -> Stream
    Output -> Stream
    Ex: filter(), sorted(), distinct() 
    Stream can have multiple Intermediate Operations
    
  - Terminal operation 
    Input -> Stream  
    Single output 
    Ex: min(), max(), forEach(), reduce(), collect()
    
 Concurrent Collection
   Concurrent collections provide Thread safe without significant performance impact in specific scenarios.
 Concurrent HashMap 
   Complete HashMap is not locked, instead few regions are locked, thus improved performance and thread safe.
   
 CopyOnWriteArrayList
    Should be used when there more read operation than write.
   
Nested Class
    - Default Nested Class - Requires outer class reference for instantiating. InnerClass innerClass = nestedClassRunner.new InnerClass();
    - Static Nested Class - Can be instantiated directly. StaticNestedClass staticNestedClass = new StaticNestedClass();

Anonymous class 
   - Inner class without a name. 
   - Can be created by implementing an Interface or by extending a Class
 

Serialization - Used of for storing the state of object in the disk or transferring over network.
Class has to implement Serializable Marker Interface for allowing serilization of instances of the class.

serialVersionUID 
    - JVM generates by default based on the members of the class.
    - Changes everytime when members are modified.
    - Used during serialization and de-serialization as unique identifier of the class.

Issues with JVM generated serialVersionUID
    - Creates issues during De-serialization if there in a modification to the existing members of the class
    - Throws an InvalidClassException, since SerialVersionUID changes on modification of existing members. 
      Hence JVM treats it as a different class

Declaring serialVersionUID
    - If we declare serialVersionUID in our class, same would be used during serialization and de-serialization.
    - Thus, even if we modify the members of the class serialVersionUID remains same. Hence JVM identifies class as 
      new version of the existing class

JIT Compiler Internal Implementation

Overloading Overriding

Marker Interface

AutoCloseable Interface
For Try with Resources implementation, Classes should implement AutoCloseable Interface.

Logging Configuration
	Log Level: 
		ERROR	: Only should be used if error occurs. Ex: Can be used in catch block
		WARN 	: Should be used for warning. Ex: If there is 0 output for a search 
		INFO	: Can be used providing info. Ex: User logged in, User logged out.
		DEBUG	: When we need to know about steps progressed. Ex: Entering a method, Exiting a method
		TRACE	: More details logs.
		
	Spring-jcl - provides logging in Spring Boot. It comes along with Spring-Boot-Started-Web
	
	By default logs will be written to console

	Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass());
	logger.info("Logging the information..");

Configuration File

Logger vs Appender
	Logger : Captures logging information from the code
	Appender : Publishes information that has been logged
		- Console Appender
		- Rolling File Appender

System.out.prinln doesn't have a severity level, whereas using logging we can have different severity levels

Configuring Logging in Spring Boot App
	- Log levels can be configured in Application.properties.
	- Can be configured in XML files of below mentioned names	
		+ logback-spring.xml
		+ logback.xml
		+ logback-spring.groovy
		+ logback.groovy
	- Console and Rolling File appenders can be configured in the XML file
	- Attribute in file
		+ Property : A variable with a value
		Ex: Below line indicates a folder named "logs" would be created in the current directory where all logs will be saved
		<property name="LOGS" value="./logs"/> 
		+ Appender : Publishes information that has been logged
			- Console Appender : Logs to System.out or System.err
			- File Appender : Logs to a file
			- Rolling File Appender : Roll over log files when conditions are met
		+ Rolling File Properties
			- %i : Represents numeric file version. When file reaches the max size new file would be created with name appended with increment
			- %d : Rolling over date, Creating a log file based on Day or Month or Year 
			- Add .gz or .zip for automatic compression
			- maxHistory : How many history files to keep after which it would be deleted by housekeeping
			- maxFileSize : Max size of a Log file, after this is reached %i would be incremented.
			- minIndex : Start index of rollover count
			- maxIndex : Ending index of rollover count
			- Behvaior : With log%i.txt filename, minIndex - 1, maxIndex - 3 when max file size is reached
				log3.txt would be deleted 
				log2.txt would be renamed to log3.txt		
				log1.txt would be renamed to log2.txt
				log.txt would be renamed to log1.txt 
		+ Pattern identifiers	
			- %d : Date of Logging event
			- %p : Logging priority(DEBUG,INFO)
			- %C : Class name that is logging
			- %t : Thread that is logging
			- %m : Message supplied for logging
			- %n : Operating system line break
	
Garbage Collection
	- Daemon thread that runs in the background
	- It frees up heap memory by destroying the unreachable objects
	- Unreachable objects are the one which are not referenced by any part of the program
	- We can choose the Garbage Collection for our program by using JVM parameter

Automatic Garbage Collection Working: 
	- Automatic GC is the process of identifying (marking) the unreachable objects and destroying(sweep) them with compaction.
	- Issue with this approach is, as the number of objects increase GC(mark and sweep) time increases
	- For improving the performance Generational GC methodology was introduced.
		- Heap is divided into generations like Young Generation, Old Generation and Permanent Generation
