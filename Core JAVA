Heap Memory - Will store the objects
Stack Memory - Will store the variables

Primitive variable - will have variable values
Reference variable - will have reference to the memory location

Comparison of reference variable compares its memory location not the values of instance variables.

String - Immutable
Once created, value cannot be changed in the memory location.

Variable Arguments. Takes any number inputs to a method. Introduced in JDK 5
Syntax : sum (int... marks) 
Sample method call: sum(2,3) sum(2,3,5)

Variable argument should always be last arugment inside a method.
Ex: sum(int length,int... num ) - Correct
Ex: sum(int... num, int length) - Wrong

Arrays:
int[] intArray = new int[5];
intArray = {1,2,3};
int[] newArray = {5,6,7}
